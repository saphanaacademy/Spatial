## Description
In this exercise / demo, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate S/4HANA (on-premise) and ESRI GIS data at the data level in a HANA database. This integrated data will be consumed in SAP Analytics Cloud.

## Overview

* In S/4HANA CDS views are created to combine customer sales, product, and location information
* The Data Provisioning Agent is installed and the ABAP adapter is registered with the SAP HANA system
* A Remote Connection is made from the HANA system to the S/4HANA system
* Virtual Tables of the S/4HANA CDS views are created
* In HANA the virtual tables from the S/4HANA data are combined with spatial tables in calculation views for consumption

## Target group

* People interested in learning about extending S/4HANA (on-premise) with ESRI spatial data 
* People interested in extending S/4HANA with a HANA sidecar
* Data analysts and developers


## Prerequisites
  
Here is a list of the equipment prerequisites for this exercise. A link to the prerequisites page is farther below.

* A fully activated S/4HANA on-premise trial system
* An SAP HANA system (for this exercise you will use the HANA database on S/4HANA to emulate having a separate system)
* An SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) account

Here are the knowledge prerequisites for this exercise.

* Familiarity with ABAP CDS views in S/4HANA
* Familiarity with Calculation views in SAP HANA
* Familiarity with Story design in SAP Analytics Cloud

## <a name="tasks"></a> Tasks

After you've completed the prerequisites there are a number of main tasks to complete. Some of these tasks will consist of running code in the Eclipse IDE with SAP tools. The Eclipse IDE is installed on the Windows client of the S/4HANA trial appliance. You will also need to import several HANA pieces like a sample database and some Calculation Vews.

1. You need to create two ABAP CDS views in our S/4HANA system. The first CDS view that needs to be created will include sales amounts by customer > location > product. The second CDS view that needs to be created will be a customer location hierarchy. This hierarchical data will be used later on in SAC for the mapping component.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Go to Task 1: Creation of CDS Views in S/4HANA](exercises/s4hViews.md)

2. You need to create a HANA database user that has the rights to create Remote Sources and tables, import objects, create Calculation Views, etc. As mentioned in the Prerequisites section, you will use the HANA database on your S/4HANA trial system to emulate having a separate HANA database / HANA sidecar. This will save you some time and perhaps money associated with readying a development HANA system for this exercise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Go to Task 2: Creation of Developer User for the SAP HANA System](exercises/hdbUser.md)

3. The next task includes installing the Data Provisioning Agent, activating HANA's Data Provisioning server, creating Virtual Tables for the ABAP CDS views we created earlier.

4. A sample database is used for this exercise and consists of US Census data as well as a table used to approximate the Longitude and Latitude of customer addresses in the S/4HANA sales data. Existing data will be transformed into HANA spatial type data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Go to Task 4: Setup of Sample Spatial Data for the SAP HANA System](exercises/hdbData.md)

5. New HANA Calculation Views will be built that combine the remote S/4HANA customer sales data with the local Census data. One view will also feature a HANA Spatial Join. These views will be consumed in the SAP Analytics Cloud where one view is used in a map location hierarchy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Go to Task 5: Creation of HANA Calculation Views on Integrated Data](exercises/hdbViews.md.md)

6. The SAP HANA system must be configured so that resources like Calculation Views are available to be consumed on the SAP Analytics Cloud. An additional component will be installed on HANA and then Cross Origin Resource Sharing will be configured.
